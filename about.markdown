My name is Vahid Rafiei, a Backend & DevOps engineer based in Stockholm, Sweden.

I am a Java Backend Developer with a broad knowledge of DevOps and Security.
I'm mostly obsessed with the Microservice-based Cloud Architecture and API Security.
For DevOps, I use Docker, Kubernetes, GCloud, Jenkins, Scriptings (Ruby, Python, Groovy, Bash), and many state-of-art tools to accomplish the targets.
