This is one of those books that put marks on one's life. Something like a punch in the face and an awakening voice.
A masterpiece, I must say.
Although the author is a professional writer (mostly fiction books) and is religious (and it bends his arguments towards the mumbo jumbo sides sometimes), his message is solid and profound.

Here is a gist of it:
Between you and your true self, there is a gap which is called "Resistance". This resistance is created and fueled by "Fear".
Anyone's primary and the most vital duty is to fight this resistance (hence the fear) by doing "Action" against it in the very moment of life when she feels it.

If you are familiar with mythology, you know that we have lots of demons and angels. The Resistance (and fear) is one of those demons that needs a constant and permanent battle at every moment.
Something like fighting "Ahriman" in Zoroastrianism.

I do recommend this book to anyone who is suffering from procrastination. The book is full of metaphors (or is it?) so be aware of the language delicates...
